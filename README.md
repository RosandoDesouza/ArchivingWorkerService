# ArchivingWorkerService
Configurable worker service to archiving data

## Primary responsibility:
1. Archiving date
2. Maintain log in console(i.e. only see while developing), text file and sqlite db

## Secondary responsibility:
1. Create new structure for the day, based on archived data structure. (Note: this part is currently, harder coded to structure required my me.)
